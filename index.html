            <h2>About Me</h2>            
            <p>Hi! I'm Luis Manuel Ríos Alvarado. I'm currently studying Software Engineering in a part-time boot camp while also working, as I transition into the tech field. Although I’m new to tech, I bring a solid background in hospitality and travel, with professional experience in hotels and travel agencies. 
            These roles have helped me develop strong communication, problem-solving, and customer service skills—qualities I now apply to my coding journey.</p>
