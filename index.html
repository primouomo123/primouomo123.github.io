            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Luis Manuel Ríos Alvarado. I'm currently studying Software Engineering in a part-time boot camp while also working, as I transition into the tech field. Although I’m new to tech, I bring a solid background in hospitality and travel, with professional experience in hotels and travel agencies.

These roles have helped me develop strong communication, problem-solving, and customer service skills—qualities I now apply to my coding journey. So far, I’ve learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I’m using these tools to build responsive websites and interactive features. I'm gaining hands-on experience through projects and continuously developing my programming and web development abilities.

I'm excited to keep growing and eventually bring my unique perspective into a tech career.</p>
