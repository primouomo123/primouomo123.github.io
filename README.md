# Personal Website

This is my website where I will be uploading my projects. All projects are linked to their corresponding GitHub repo. I will keep updating the content regularly.

I've checked my website on https://validator.w3.org/ and it says "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

I've written comments in both HTML and CSS files, so it's easier to understand everything I've done.

The website is responsive and the projects section's layout is Grid, as requested.
