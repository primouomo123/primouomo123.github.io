# Personal Website

This is my website where I will be uploading my projects. All projects are linked to their corresponding GitHub repo. I will keep updating the content regularly.

I've checked my website on https://validator.w3.org/ and it says "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

I've written comments in both HTML and CSS files, so it's easier to understand everything I've done.
